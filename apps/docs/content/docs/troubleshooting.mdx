# Troubleshooting

## CLI is running, but no webhooks are captured

Checklist:

- Confirm your provider points to the correct URL (`http://localhost:3001/webhooks/your-provider`).
- If your provider cannot reach localhost, expose the capture server through a tunnel (for example `ngrok` or `cloudflared`).
- Verify the capture server is actually running:

```bash
better-webhook capture --port 3001
```

<Callout type="info">
  The capture server accepts any request path and stores full request metadata.
</Callout>

## `captures replay` says capture not found or selector is ambiguous

- List captures first and copy a concrete capture ID:

```bash
better-webhook captures list
```

- Use the full or unique prefix capture ID:

```bash
better-webhook captures replay <capture-id> http://localhost:3000/api/webhooks/github
```

## Signature verification fails in SDK handlers

Most failures come from one of these:

- Wrong secret value (`GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, `RAGIE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, `RECALL_WEBHOOK_SECRET`).
- Body parser mutated the request body before verification.
- Provider is signing with a different secret than your environment.

For framework-specific raw-body requirements, see [Adapters](/docs/sdk/adapters).

## NestJS or Express handlers behave unexpectedly

- Express must use `express.raw({ type: "application/json" })` for webhook routes.
- NestJS should preserve raw body and handle `204` responses with `.end()` when no response body is returned.

Reference examples: [SDK Getting Started](/docs/sdk) and [Adapters](/docs/sdk/adapters).

## `templates run` fails with secret-related errors

If a template requires provider signing placeholders, pass a secret explicitly:

```bash
better-webhook templates run github-push http://localhost:3000/api/webhooks/github --secret "$GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET"
```

Or set provider env vars:

- `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
- `RAGIE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
- `RECALL_WEBHOOK_SECRET`

## `better-webhook` command is not found after installation

- Verify installation:

```bash
better-webhook --version
```

- If installed manually, make sure the binary is on your `PATH`.
- If using Homebrew, retry install:

```bash
brew install --cask endalk200/tap/better-webhook
```
