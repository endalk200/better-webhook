# Better Webhook

Two tools, one goal: make webhook development delightful.

## The Problem

Building webhook handlers is painful:

- **No local testing** — You need to expose localhost with ngrok or similar tools just to receive webhooks during development
- **Trial and error** — Testing requires triggering real events (pushing code, creating issues) repeatedly
- **No type safety** — Webhook payloads are untyped `any` objects, leading to runtime errors
- **Manual verification** — Implementing HMAC signature verification correctly is error-prone and tedious
- **No replay** — When something breaks, you can't easily re-test with the same payload

## The Solution

Better Webhook provides two independent tools that solve these problems:

<Cards>
  <Card
    icon={<Terminal />}
    title="CLI Tool"
    description="Capture real webhooks, replay them locally, and test with pre-built templates. No ngrok required."
    href="/docs/cli"
  />
  <Card
    icon={<Code2 />}
    title="SDK Packages"
    description="Type-safe webhook handlers with automatic signature verification. Works with Next.js, Express, and NestJS."
    href="/docs/sdk"
  />
</Cards>

## Quick Comparison

| Need | Tool |
|------|------|
| Test webhooks locally without exposing ports | CLI |
| Replay captured webhooks during debugging | CLI |
| Use pre-built webhook templates | CLI |
| Visual dashboard for webhook management | CLI |
| Type-safe webhook handlers in production | SDK |
| Automatic signature verification | SDK |
| Zod schema validation for payloads | SDK |

## Choose Your Path

**Starting local development?** → [Get started with the CLI](/docs/cli)

**Building webhook handlers?** → [Get started with the SDK](/docs/sdk)

Both tools work great together but are completely independent. Use whichever fits your needs.
