# Contributing

## Prerequisites

- Node.js `>=18`
- `pnpm` (workspace package manager)
- `devbox` and `just` (primary task runner workflow)
- Go toolchain (for CLI-focused changes)

## Project workflow

This repository uses `devbox` + `just` as the standard workflow interface.

Install dependencies:

```bash
devbox run -- just ci-install
```

Run standard checks from repo root:

```bash
devbox run -- just format-check
devbox run -- just lint
devbox run -- just test
devbox run -- just build
```

Package-scoped checks:

```bash
devbox run -- just lint-package <package>
devbox run -- just test-package <package>
devbox run -- just build-package <package>
```

<Callout type="info">
  Prefer `just` tasks for repository workflows to keep local and CI behavior aligned.
</Callout>

## Docs contribution guidelines

- Keep command examples copy-pasteable and verified against source.
- Keep internal links under `/docs/*` valid.
- Prefer concise, task-oriented sections over long marketing copy in reference docs.
- When changing CLI commands or flags, update both CLI docs and docs-site landing examples.

## Pull request checklist

- Include tests or rationale when tests are not needed.
- Run lint/test/build locally before opening PR.
- Update docs for behavior changes.
- Keep changes scoped and include migration notes when needed.

## Release contribution notes

- SDK package releases are managed via Changesets.
- CLI releases are tag-based (`v*`) and built with GoReleaser.

See [Release Policy](/docs/release-policy) for release workflow details.
