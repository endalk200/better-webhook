# FAQ

## Do I need both the CLI and the SDK?

No. They are independent:

- Use the CLI when you need local webhook capture, replay, and repeatable template testing.
- Use the SDK when you need type-safe, verified webhook handlers in your application.

Many teams use both: CLI for local debugging, SDK for production endpoints.

## Which webhook providers are supported?

The SDK includes providers for:

- GitHub
- Ragie
- Recall.ai

You can also define custom providers using `@better-webhook/core`. See [Providers](/docs/sdk/providers#custom-providers).

## Which frameworks are supported?

Official adapters are available for:

- Next.js
- Express
- NestJS
- Hono
- GCP Cloud Functions

See [Adapters](/docs/sdk/adapters) for setup details.

## Can I use Better Webhook without exposing localhost publicly?

Yes. For replay and template-based testing, localhost is enough.

For receiving live events from external services, your provider still needs to reach your capture endpoint. If localhost is unreachable from the provider, use a tunnel.

## Does Better Webhook verify signatures automatically?

Yes, when secrets are configured. You can provide secrets through adapter options, provider options, or provider-specific environment variables. See [Security](/docs/security).

## Why do I get `204` responses from the SDK?

`204` usually means no matching handler executed for that event, or no response body is returned by design. This can be expected behavior for unhandled events.

## Where are CLI captures and templates stored?

By default under `~/.better-webhook/`:

- `captures/`
- `templates/`

You can override paths with command flags like `--captures-dir` and `--templates-dir`.

## How are releases published?

- SDK packages are published through Changesets from `main`.
- CLI binaries are published from version tags (`v*`) via GoReleaser.

See [Release Policy](/docs/release-policy).
