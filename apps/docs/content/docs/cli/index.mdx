# CLI Getting Started

The Better Webhook CLI is a local development tool for capturing, replaying, and testing webhooks without exposing your localhost to the internet.

## Installation

### Homebrew (Recommended)

```bash
brew install endalk200/tap/better-webhook
```

### Go install

```bash
go install github.com/endalk200/better-webhook/apps/webhook-cli/cmd/better-webhook@latest
```

To install a pinned release:

```bash
go install github.com/endalk200/better-webhook/apps/webhook-cli/cmd/better-webhook@vX.Y.Z
```

### Manual download

Download the latest binary for your platform from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/endalk200/better-webhook/releases):

| Platform      | Binary Name                   |
| ------------- | ----------------------------- |
| macOS (ARM)   | `better-webhook-darwin-arm64` |
| macOS (Intel) | `better-webhook-darwin-x64`   |
| Linux (x64)   | `better-webhook-linux-x64`    |
| Linux (ARM)   | `better-webhook-linux-arm64`  |
| Windows       | `better-webhook-windows-x64.exe` |

```bash
# Example: macOS ARM
curl -L https://github.com/endalk200/better-webhook/releases/latest/download/better-webhook-darwin-arm64 -o better-webhook
chmod +x better-webhook
sudo mv better-webhook /usr/local/bin/
```

### Verify Installation

```bash
better-webhook --version
```

## Quick Start

Use a terminal-only workflow to capture and replay real webhook traffic:

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Start capture server

    ```bash
    better-webhook capture --port 3001
    ```

    The CLI listens on `http://localhost:3001` and stores captures in `~/.better-webhook/captures`.

  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Point Webhooks to the Capture Server

    Configure your webhook source (GitHub, Ragie, Recall.ai, etc.) to send webhooks to:

    ```
    http://localhost:3001/webhooks/your-provider
    ```

    Tip: The capture server accepts **any** path and stores the request with headers and body.

    <Callout type="info">
      Use a tunnel service like ngrok or cloudflared to expose the capture server if your webhook source can't reach localhost.
    </Callout>

  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Trigger a Webhook

    Perform an action that triggers a webhook (push code, create an issue, etc.). The webhook is saved locally.

  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Replay to your local server

    In a second terminal, list captures and replay one to your app:

    ```bash
    better-webhook captures list
    better-webhook captures replay <capture-id> \
    http://localhost:3000/api/webhooks/github
    ```

    You can replay the same webhook as many times as needed while debugging.

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Using Templates

Don't have real webhooks to test with? Use pre-built templates:

```bash
# List available templates
better-webhook templates list

# Download a template
better-webhook templates download github-push

# Run a template against your endpoint
better-webhook templates run github-push http://localhost:3000/api/webhooks/github
```

Templates include proper headers and can generate valid signatures when you provide a secret.

<Callout type="info">
  The legacy npm-distributed CLI is being retired. Use Homebrew, manual binaries,
  or `go install` for the Go CLI.
