# CLI Getting Started

The Better Webhook CLI is a local development tool for capturing, replaying, and testing webhooks without exposing your localhost to the internet.

## Installation

### Standalone Binary (Recommended)

Download a standalone binary - no Node.js required.

**macOS (Homebrew)**

```bash
brew install endalk200/tap/better-webhook
```

**Manual Download**

Download the latest binary for your platform from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/endalk200/better-webhook/releases):

| Platform      | Binary Name                   |
| ------------- | ----------------------------- |
| macOS (ARM)   | `better-webhook-darwin-arm64` |
| macOS (Intel) | `better-webhook-darwin-x64`   |
| Linux (x64)   | `better-webhook-linux-x64`    |
| Linux (ARM)   | `better-webhook-linux-arm64`  |
| Windows       | `better-webhook-windows-x64.exe` |

```bash
# Example: macOS ARM
curl -L https://github.com/endalk200/better-webhook/releases/latest/download/better-webhook-darwin-arm64 -o better-webhook
chmod +x better-webhook
sudo mv better-webhook /usr/local/bin/
```

### NPM (Alternative)

<Tabs groupId="package-manager" items={["npm", "pnpm", "yarn"]}>
  <Tab value="npm">
  ```bash
  npm install -g @better-webhook/cli
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="pnpm">
  ```bash
  pnpm add -g @better-webhook/cli
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="yarn">
  ```bash
  yarn global add @better-webhook/cli
  ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Or use with npx (no installation required):

```bash
npx @better-webhook/cli --help
```

### Verify Installation

```bash
better-webhook --version
```

## Quick Start

The fastest way to get started is with the dashboard command, which starts both the UI and a capture server:

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Start the Dashboard

    ```bash
    better-webhook dashboard
    ```

    This starts:
    - **Dashboard UI** at `http://localhost:4000`
    - **Capture Server** at `http://localhost:3001`

  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Point Webhooks to the Capture Server

    Configure your webhook source (GitHub, Ragie, etc.) to send webhooks to:

    ```
    http://localhost:3001/webhooks/your-provider
    ```

    <Callout type="info">
      Use a tunnel service like ngrok or cloudflared to expose the capture server if your webhook source can't reach localhost.
    </Callout>

  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Trigger a Webhook

    Perform an action that triggers a webhook (push code, create an issue, etc.). The webhook will be captured and appear in the dashboard.

  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Replay to Your Local Server

    From the dashboard, select a captured webhook and replay it to your local development server:

    ```
    http://localhost:3000/api/webhooks/github
    ```

    You can replay the same webhook as many times as needed while debugging.

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Alternative: CLI-Only Workflow

If you prefer working entirely in the terminal:

```bash
# Start the capture server
better-webhook capture --port 3001

# In another terminal, list captured webhooks
better-webhook captures list

# Replay a captured webhook
better-webhook replay abc12345 http://localhost:3000/api/webhooks/github
```

## Using Templates

Don't have real webhooks to test with? Use pre-built templates:

```bash
# List available templates
better-webhook templates list

# Download a template
better-webhook templates download github-push

# Run a template against your endpoint
better-webhook run github-push --url http://localhost:3000/api/webhooks/github
```

Templates include proper headers and can generate valid signatures when you provide a secret.
