# CLI Getting Started

The Better Webhook CLI is a local development tool for capturing, replaying, and testing webhooks without exposing your localhost to the internet.

## Installation

Install the CLI globally:

```bash
npm install -g @better-webhook/cli
```

Verify the installation:

```bash
better-webhook --version
```

## Quick Start

The fastest way to get started is with the dashboard command, which starts both the UI and a capture server:

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Start the Dashboard

    ```bash
    better-webhook dashboard
    ```

    This starts:
    - **Dashboard UI** at `http://localhost:4000`
    - **Capture Server** at `http://localhost:3001`

  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Point Webhooks to the Capture Server

    Configure your webhook source (GitHub, Ragie, etc.) to send webhooks to:

    ```
    http://localhost:3001/webhooks/your-provider
    ```

    <Callout type="info">
      Use a tunnel service like ngrok or cloudflared to expose the capture server if your webhook source can't reach localhost.
    </Callout>

  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Trigger a Webhook

    Perform an action that triggers a webhook (push code, create an issue, etc.). The webhook will be captured and appear in the dashboard.

  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Replay to Your Local Server

    From the dashboard, select a captured webhook and replay it to your local development server:

    ```
    http://localhost:3000/api/webhooks/github
    ```

    You can replay the same webhook as many times as needed while debugging.

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Alternative: CLI-Only Workflow

If you prefer working entirely in the terminal:

```bash
# Start the capture server
better-webhook capture --port 3001

# In another terminal, list captured webhooks
better-webhook captures list

# Replay a captured webhook
better-webhook replay abc12345 http://localhost:3000/api/webhooks/github
```

## Using Templates

Don't have real webhooks to test with? Use pre-built templates:

```bash
# List available templates
better-webhook templates list

# Download a template
better-webhook templates download github-push

# Run a template against your endpoint
better-webhook run github-push --url http://localhost:3000/api/webhooks/github
```

Templates include proper headers and can generate valid signatures when you provide a secret.
