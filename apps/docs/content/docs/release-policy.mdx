# Release Policy

## Release channels

Better Webhook has two release channels:

- SDK packages (npm)
- CLI binaries (GitHub Releases + Homebrew tap)

## SDK package releases

SDK packages are published from `main` using Changesets.

High-level flow:

1. Changesets are added for package changes.
2. CI validates formatting, linting, type checks, tests, and build.
3. Changesets action creates a release PR or publishes packages.
4. Tags are pushed after successful publish.

Primary workflow: [`.github/workflows/release.yml`](https://github.com/endalk200/better-webhook/blob/main/.github/workflows/release.yml)

## CLI releases

CLI releases are tag-triggered (`v*`) and built through GoReleaser.

High-level flow:

1. Push a semantic tag such as `v1.2.3`.
2. CI runs format/lint/test/build.
3. GoReleaser builds archives for macOS/Linux/Windows.
4. Checksums and signatures are generated.
5. Release artifacts are published and Homebrew cask is updated.

Primary workflows/config:

- [`.github/workflows/release-cli.yml`](https://github.com/endalk200/better-webhook/blob/main/.github/workflows/release-cli.yml)
- [`.goreleaser.yaml`](https://github.com/endalk200/better-webhook/blob/main/.goreleaser.yaml)

## Versioning expectations

- Use semantic versioning for both SDK and CLI.
- Breaking changes should be clearly indicated in release notes.
- Patch versions should remain backward compatible.

## Where to find release artifacts

- SDK packages: npm (`@better-webhook/*`)
- CLI binaries and release notes: GitHub Releases
- Homebrew install path:

```bash
brew install --cask endalk200/tap/better-webhook
```
